<p>The Centres of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) independently manage the information stored in, or made accessible by, the CGIAR
System-wide Information Network for Genetic Resources (SINGER). Users must contact the specific CGIAR Centre(s) directly, with any questions or comments regarding information stored
in SINGER and for queries regarding the germplasm held in the appropriate CGIAR Centre. The contact person for each Centre can be found <a href="/index.jsp?page=members">here</a>.</p>
<p>The responsibility of managing orders created using SINGER's Online Germplasm Ordering System remains with the Centres of the CGIAR. Therefore, SINGER and Bioversity
International, as SINGER's legal host entity, will not be held responsible for any errors or negligence in handling the request, or for the inability to fulfill any order. Once an
order is completed via the Online Germplasm Ordering System, the party requesting the germplasm will be sent a summary of the order specifying the CGIAR Centre(s) which will be
processing the germplasm order and the contact person for each Centre. Possible claims and complaints related to germplasm orders must be addressed to the specific CGIAR Centre
concerned, and not to SINGER.</p>
<p>Those requesting germplasm via the SINGER Online Germplasm Ordering System will be provided with the terms and conditions for the use of the germplasm from the relevant CGIAR Centre(s) processing the order.</p>
<p>Should the internet service providers, or the facilities associated to SINGER and its Ordering System, fail due to causes beyond the control of SINGER or Bioversity, neither
SINGER nor Bioversity will be held responsible for any delays in transmission, delivery, or fulfillment of orders due to these failures.</p>
