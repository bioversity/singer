</span><span class="BodyGray"><br/>
The agreements require the centres to make all information on the in trust collections easily available without restriction, just as the material itself is available. SINGER was established to help the centres meet these responsibilities.<br>
<br/>
The collections and the information related to them are held by individual genebanks. SINGER brings together these independent genebank databases and permits their easy access and interrogation.<br>
<br/>
</span><span class="TitleBlue">SINGER thus permits one stop public access to information on more than half a million in trust samples of plant diversity. </span></p>
