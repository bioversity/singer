Plant diversity is the key to sustainable agriculture - it can not only feed the hungry, but also improve livelihoods and protect the environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyGray">To be able to use this diversity to impove lives and livelihoods, people need access to information about the genetic resources conserved in collections around the world.<br>
<br>
Much of the earth&rsquo;s plant diversity is stored in genebanks. The largest collections of the crops that are most important for improving nutrition and incomes are held by the CGIAR Centres, a network of 15 agricultural research institutions located throughout the world. The Centres hold in public trust the world's largest seed collections, and foster research and policies to bring the benefits of agricultural diversity to poor farmers.<br>
<br>
In 1994, the international agricultural community recognized the need to protect the important crop diversity collections held by the CGIAR. In response, the CGIAR Centres placed their collections under the inter-governmental authority of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). That arrangement has been succeeded by the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, which entered into force in June 2004.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyGray">In addition to promoting the collection and conservation of plant genetic resources, the Treaty supports the exchange of associated information to ensure that it is freely available to those who need it. Guaranteeing access to this information without restriction is imperative for effective implementation of the Treaty<br>
</span><span class="BodyGray"><br>
</span><span class="TitleBlue">SINGER makes information about the diversity of plants available to all. It provides a gateway to the knowledge that makes collections of crop diversity more useful to farmers, plant breeders and researchers.<br>
