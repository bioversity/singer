It meets the needs of researchers, plant breeders, farmers and conservers in their efforts to improve production and sustain food security. It changed from being a source of information to a dynamic network that harnesses expertise and information to further the conservation and use of plant genetic resources.</span></p>
							<p><span class="MediumTitleBlue">The SINGER model and the expertise, tools and infrastructure</span><span class="BodyGray"> of the network are available to assist others to establish their own information networks. For example, SINGER has been contracted to implement the European catalogue of crop genetic resources collections (EURISCO). It was asked to help develop an Internet &shy;based information system for the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC).</span></p>
							<p><span class="MediumTitleBlue">SINGER encourages networking on the basis of crop and geographical regions.</span><span class="BodyGray"> Currently, to link holders of wheat, barley and sweet potato collections worldwide, pilot networks are being established. These efforts are being led by the Future Harvest Centres responsible for those crops.</span></p>

								<li><span class="BodyGray">Sweet potato - The International Potato Center (CIP)</span>
							</ul>
							<p><span class="MediumTitleBlue">With efforts such as these, SINGER aims to be a major contributor to the development of the global information system for plant genetic resources envisaged by the FAO.</span></p>
