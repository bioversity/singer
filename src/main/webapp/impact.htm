<p><span class="TitleBlue">SINGER&rsquo;s impact on the lives of resource - poor farmers</span><span class="TitleOrange"> </span><span class="BodyGray">is essentially indirect and therefore difficult to assess. However, we take it as axiomatic that genetic diversity can be managed and used to improve the food security and livelihoods of the poorest people. SINGER makes a vital contribution to that effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyGray">Aside from its direct involvement with numerous breeding programmes, SINGER has also had other important functions:</span></p>
<ul type=square>
<li><span class="BodyGray">The restoration of local genetic resources in times of crisis</span>
<li><span class="BodyGray">Tracking movement of resources to examine possible violations of in-trust agreements</span>
<li><span class="BodyGray">Pre-screening accessions for particular traits</span>
<li><span class="BodyGray">Locating under-represented areas for future collecting missions</span>
<li><span class="BodyGray">Helping to identify accessions for repatriation</span>
<li><span class="BodyGray">Supporting research into issues such as taxonomic relationships among accessions.</span>
